# AV-Website-2nd-try
For this website, I started with establishing the layout. The HTML had 5 sections (including the head), each having sub-sections to allow for separation and sectioning of parts of the webpage, and allowing multiple classes in CSS for formatting, namely column vs. row. In total the navigation had 4 sections. After the header, I set up the sections, each with their own link in the navigation bar.

While the "About Me" and "Photo of past works" were straightforward, for the "Samples of past work" and "footer," I had to use multiple divs and classes, to format the YouTube videos to be 2X2, and the footer for both text and text-input to be centered and allow input. 
Then I wrote the bio, and uploaded some photos in specific dimensions, as well as a row for the upright ones, as part of the requirements. 
For the YouTube videos, I had to change "watch?v="" with "embed/" within iframes to make it work within the webpage.
Then for the footer, I created a contact section to allow contact in the future, including their contact information to respond back via email.

Decoratively, I added font-size, font-weight, text-shadow, borders, border radius, and different background colors. This was my first attempt at building a website. The webpage came out effective yet aesthetically presentable.
